Hi! I'm Ragan Lee, and I'm a Sophmore in the College of Engineering. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in CTD. I was born and raised in Boulder County, and have lived in Boulder for most of my life. My hobbies include art, skiing, climbing, hiking, and video games. My favorite animal at the moment is a hammerhead shark, and my favorite flower is a blue bell (I even have a tattoo of them!).
