    <h2><b>Some moreee about me: </b></h2>
    <p>I <em>love</em> art, coding, climbing, video games, hiking, and skiing! </p>
    <p>I plan on becoming a software engineer after undergrad, and my dream job would be working in Game Dev.</p>
    <p>In this course I hope to learn more about designing and coding websites, and develop the skills needed to build some works for my portfolio (or even a personal site!)</p>
