        Orion is a saftey app concept I developed as a final project in my Human Computer Interaction course. I then went on to further improve the app design once the course was finished.
    <br>
    <br>
            The core problem I wanted to tackle with this project was creating a safety app that appealed to college students and addressed their needs when it came to safety. I surveyed my peers to figure out what they needed to feel safe when walking.
    I found that the majority of students I surveyed prefeered busy streets with lots of people, and would go out of their way to find popular areas to walk, especially at night. I also found that my peers were traveling at night both alone and in a group, and wanted an easy way to alert friends if an emergency occured.
    In addition, many students expressed concerns about losing people when in a large group. 
    <br>
    <br>
        While Orion has the typical features of a safety app: a way to see friends' locations, an emergency alert button, and a map that you can search for people and places on, I wanted to focus on experimenting with creating community-centric features within Orion.
    So, Orion also has a special group travel setting: users can add their friends to their "group", and the app forms a circle around the user and their chosen friends. If a friend leaves the circle, an alert is sent. I created a feature within the map where the map will suggest the most popular path to a location, which is based on the frequency of the path's use by other Orion members.
    Finally, there is Orion community, which is a hub for the city you are in that shows you latest emergencies and users in the community can give feedback for locations and paths. This provides a way for users to stay aware of current events unfolding nearby, and ensure saftey risks are brought to their attention.
